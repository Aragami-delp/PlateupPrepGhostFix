# PlateupPrepGhost
A small mod to disable player collision on walls and items during the preparation phase to avoid the tedium of moving everything around.

This mod will upon entering the preparation phase, disable collision between players and any geometry (walls, counters, tables, etc.)

When entering any other mode, collision will be automatically re-enabled.
